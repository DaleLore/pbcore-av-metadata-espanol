<pbcoreDescription source="American Experience website">On April 28,
1881, just days from being hanged for murder, 21-year-old Henry McCarty,
alias Billy the Kid, outfoxed his jailors and electrified the nation with the
last in a long line of daring escapes. Just a few weeks later, he was finally
gunned down by an ambitious sheriff, and the felling of one of the most
notorious criminals of the age made headlines across the
country.</pbcoreDescription>

<pbcoreDescription source="American Experience website">The legend of
Jesse James is one of America’s most familiar myths – and one of its most
wrong-headed. James, so the legend goes, was a Western outlaw, but in
reality, he never went west. He has been called American’s own Robin Hood,
yet he robbed both rich and poor, and was never seen to share his ill-gotten
gains. He was known as a gunfighter – but his victims were almost always
unarmed. Less heroic than brutal, James was a member of a vicious band of
Missouri guerrillas during the Civil War, and sought vengeance for the
Confederate defeat afterwards. In a life steeped in prolific violence and
bloodshed, he met what was perhaps the most fitting end.</pbcoreDescription>

<pbcoreDescription source="American Experience website">In an era in
which cold-blooded killers such as Jesse James and the Younger Brothers
terrorized the American West, Butch Cassidy, the Sundance Kid and their Wild
Bunch gang took a smart and methodical approach to bank and train robbery. In
the 1890s, their thrilling exploits – robbing banks and trains and then
seemingly vanishing into thin air – became front-page news and the basis of
rumor and myth, captivating Americans from coast to
coast.</pbcoreDescription>
